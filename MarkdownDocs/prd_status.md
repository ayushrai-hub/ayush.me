# 📊 PRD-to-Code Traceability Status — Portfolio Project

This document ensures **every requirement in the PRD and supporting docs** is tracked, verified, and implemented in the codebase.  
It acts as a **single source of truth** for progress and helps prevent **hallucinations, drift, or undocumented changes**.

- ✔ **Implemented** — feature present in code, tested, and verified.  
- ⚠ **Partial** — feature started, but missing docs/tests/optimizations.  
- ✖ **Missing** — not yet implemented.
